## What is licensing?

A licensing agreement is a written agreement by which the owner of a property gives another party permission to use that property under specified parameters (usually a payment).

## Copyright vs. Trademark

### Copyright

Copyright is a law that gives you ownership over the things you create (in your case a Video Game).
If you created it, you own it and it’s the copyright law itself that assures that ownership.

As the owner you have the following rights:

-The right to reproduce the work.  
-The right to prepare derivative works.  
-The right to distribute copies.  
-The right to distribute the work publicly.  

The duration of the Copyright is typically the author's life plus 50 to 100 years.
Copyrights do not cover:
-Titles  
-Names  
-Phrases or slogans    
-symbols and designs  
-ideas  
-procedures and methods  
-concepts or discoveries  

### Trademark

A trademark is any combination of signs, expressions (anything) that identifies a firm or a service.
It guarantees the item's uniqueness and it gives the owner legal rights to prevent its unauthorized use.
They have to be registered with the appropriate authority to obtain legal ownership and protection rights. 
Trademark rights are granted usually for 7 to 20 years and, unlike in case of patents, are renewable indefinitely.
