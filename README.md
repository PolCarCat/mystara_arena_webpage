## *What is licensing?*

A licensing agreement is a written agreement by which the owner of a property gives another party permission to use that property under specified parameters (usually a payment).

## *Copyright vs. Trademark*

  
## *Copyright*

Copyright is a law that gives you ownership over the things you create (in your case a Video Game).
If you created it, you own it and the copyright law assures it.

As the owner you have the following rights:
```
-The right to reproduce the work.  
-The right to prepare derivative works.  
-The right to distribute copies.  
-The right to distribute the work publicly.
```

The duration of the Copyright is typically the author's life plus 50 to 100 years.   
Copyright does not cover:
```
-Titles  
-Names  
-Phrases or slogans    
-Symbols and designs  
-Ideas  
-Procedures and methods  
-Concepts or discoveries  
```
## *Trademark*

A trademark is any combination of signs, expressions (anything) that identifies a firm or a service.
It guarantees the item's uniqueness and it gives the owner legal rights to prevent its unauthorized use.
It has to be registered with the appropriate authority to obtain legal ownership and protection rights. 
Trademark rights are granted usually for 7 to 20 years and unlike patents, they can be renewed indefinetly.

### *Registered Trademark, Unregistered Trademark or Service mark?*

```
-™ : This is the unregistered trademark symbol, it is used to promote a brand or its goods.
-℠ : This is the unregistered service mark symbol, it is used to promote a brand or its services.
-® : This is the registered trademark symbol.
```
## *Free software license*
A free software license grants the modification and restribution of a software.
This actions are prohibited by copyrights laws but the owner of the rights of a software can remove these
restrictions by acquiring a software license that will grant its modification/distribution.

### *Permissive Software License*   
A permissive software license is a free software license with minimal requirements about how the software will be distributed.
```
-MIT License  
-BSD License   
-Apple Public Source License   
-Apache License   
```
### *Copyleft*  
Copyleft is a type of license that consists on the author giving the person who recieves a copy of the software total permission to reproduce, change or distribute copies of the software. 
That is pretty much the contrary of copyright which is the reason why this is called copyleft (a play in the word copyright).   
It is a feature of some free software licenses
The most important license is the GNU General Public License.

Copyleft works like this:   
```
Freedom 0 – The work can be used
Freedom 1 – The work can be studied
Freedom 2 – The work can be shared and copied
Freedom 3 – The work can be modified and distributed modified
```   
In order to be 100% Copyleft, the author of the derived work will only distribute it under the same or equivalent license.

## *Open-Source software license*   
Open-source software is a type of computer software with a license in which the owner (copyright holder)
gives the rights to:  
```
-Study
-Change
-Distribute
```
  
## *Open-source vs Free-software*   

The OSI (Open Source Initiative) and the FSF (Free Software Foundation) are two organizations that approve different
licenses
