## *What is licensing?*

A licensing agreement is a written agreement by which the owner of a property gives another party permission to use that property under specified parameters (usually a payment).

## *Copyright vs. Trademark*

  
## *Copyright*

Copyright is a law that gives you ownership over the things you create (in your case a Video Game).
If you created it, you own it and the copyright law assures it.

## *Trademark*

A trademark is any combination of signs, expressions (anything) that identifies a firm or a service.
It guarantees the item's uniqueness and it gives the owner legal rights to prevent its unauthorized use.
It has to be registered with the appropriate authority to obtain legal ownership and protection rights. 
Trademark rights are granted usually for 7 to 20 years and unlike patents, they can be renewed indefinetly.

### *Registered Trademark, Unregistered Trademark or Service mark?*

```
## *Free software license*
A free software license grants the modification and restribution of a software.
This actions are prohibited by copyrights laws but the owner of the rights of a software can remove these
restrictions by acquiring a software license that will grant its modification/distribution.
